#### Description:
I created a website. The home of the site is styled with a style.css file in the theme of star wars holiday because I made it in December of 2023. A button will take you to an interactive map where there is the functionality of the site. I implemented a unique Google Maps API into my site to make an interactive map. I then added custom markers to the map with specific longitutes and latitudes, marking where certain rare italian wines are made in their true geo locations. Then using Javascript, I added a listener, and a popup when you click the icon to display information about the wine, including where the geoloaction represents, and then a description of the wine. I then coded the default Google maps marker icon to change into a custom image I selected and imported via a URL. 
I then styled up the page, added color, changed font size, ect. I added a button at the top that routes you back to the home page. I did that direclty in the HTML file.
I also have an app.py file that imports os and flask, and contains my routes of home which is just index or '/' and then '/imapp' which routes you to the interactive map. So I utilize Javascript in the HTML Files, CSS in the css file, and python in the app.py file.
